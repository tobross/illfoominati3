From where you are, you are mostly obscured from the shooter's sight.<br><br>   The shooter's ride drives off without them. In a fit, they shout threats at the fleeing crowd, seemingly in a rage. They start to walk toward some people fleeing into the trees...",

You sneak back to your vehicle with the intent to flee but remember that it sounds like a drive by every time you pump the gas. With this in mind, you drive around the car park, sounding as many of the gunshot-like sounds as you can. The shooter flees the park and thus abandons their persuit of the innocent park-goers.

You wake up in the hospital with the other victims with a horrendous headache and a swollen hand, but not critically injured."
