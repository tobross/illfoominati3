This is a web app to facilitate the game masters during the 3rd annual IllFooMinati birthday/community event.

Landing/Home: The landing page outlines the purpose of the event as well as a link near the bottom of the page for a quiz. This quiz is external and will assign a player their element based on their responses.

***Each set of 4 players must be a complete set of all 4 elements. This is known as a human. Their responses and actions are based around the elemental traits of the element they choose to respond with.***

In the drop down menu there are 5 other HTML pages to choose from.
One Vs. Self: Each of the games defined here are to be played within the group of 4 players or "1 human" to signify the internal struggles we face. Each game is defined by the title and rules are held within hidden text displayed by clicking on the "prompt" button.

One Vs. World: Also known as One Vs. Society, this page outlines 10 events that could happen in a "human" lifetime. All of this information is provided from the JSON available. Also, each button toggles a hide or show action on the relevant data for ease of use. 

When a human gets to this station, they as a group, will listen to the prompt then decide which element to respond with. They then roll a D20 (20-sided die) to detemine how successful they are. The game master will then read to them the outcome of their decision and either reward them with experience, or direct them back to Bardo (the limbo area for elements to reform a new human).

One Vs. Another: On this page, 8 games are contained. Each one of which has a button that hides and displays the information within, to make fiding the correct information easier and faster. An audio file for a "death match" is located at the top of the page as well as within any game defined as such. All of these games are played between 2 groups of 4 people or "2 humans".

Audio Cues: This page contains Audio files for Leveling up a player's element, cheers for hitting level 5 (the maximum level), death notice, and earth (the game area) closing warning.

Random Riddle: This page is a random riddle picker. It generates a random number between 1 and 100 then compares it to available information in JSON and maps that information into an HTML block that is displayed on the page. This HTML block will overwrite the last such block.

***The intent behind these games and activities is to promote the interaction of players and join more people in the community.***
